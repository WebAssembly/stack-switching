# Stack switching

This proposal adds typed stack switching to WebAssembly, enabling a single WebAssembly instance to manage multiple execution stacks concurrently. The primary use-case for stack switching is to add direct support for modular compilation of advanced non-local control flow idioms, e.g. coroutines, async/await, yield-style generators, lightweight threads, and so forth. This document outlines the new instructions and validation rules to facilitate stack switching.

## Examples

In this section we give a series of examples illustrating possible encodings of common non-local control flow idioms.

### Yield-style generators

```c
// Producer: a stream of naturals
void nats() {
  int32_t i = 0;
  for (;; i++) yield i; // supposed control name for yielding control with payload `i` to the surrounding context
}

// Consumer: sums up some slice of the `nats` stream
int32_t sumUp(int32_t upto) {
  int32_t n = 0, // current value
          s = 0; // accumulator
  while (n < upto) {
    switch (nats()) {
       case yield(int32_t i): // pattern matching on the control name
         n = i;  // save the current value
         s += n; // update the accumulator
         continue;
       default: // `nats` returned
          return s;
    }
  }
  return s;
}

sumUp(10); // returns 55
```

## Specification changes

This proposal is based on the [function references proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/function-references) and [exception handling proposal](https://github.com/WebAssembly/exception-handling).

### Types

We extend the structure of composite types and heap types as follows.

- `cont <typeidx>` is a new form of composite type
  - `(cont $ft) ok` iff `$ft ok` and `$ft = [t1*] -> [t2*]`

We add two new continuation heap types and their subtyping hierachy:
- `heaptypes ::= ... | cont | nocont`
- `nocont ok` and `cont ok` always
- `nocont` is the bottom type of continuation types, whereas `cont` is the top type, i.e. `nocont <: cont`

### Instructions

The new instructions and their validation rules are as follows. To simplify the presentation, we write this:

```
C.types[$ct] ~~ cont [t1*] -> [t2*]
```

where we really mean this:

```
C.types[$ct] ~~ cont $ft
C.types[$ft] ~~ func [t1*] -> [t2*]
```

This abbreviation will be formalized with an auxiliary function or other means in the spec.

- `cont.new <typeidx>`
  - Create a new continuation from a given typed funcref.
  - `cont.new $ct : [(ref null? $ft)] -> [(ref $ct)]`
    - iff `C.types[$ct] ~~ cont [t1*] -> [t2*]`

- `cont.bind <typeidx> <typeidx>`
  - Partially apply a continuation.
  - `cont.bind $ct $ct' : [t3* (ref null? $ct)] -> [(ref $ct')]`
    - iff `C.types[$ct'] ~~ cont [t1'*] -> [t2'*]`
    - and `C.types[$ct] ~~ cont [t1* t3*] -> [t2*]`
    - and `[t1*] -> [t2*] <: [t1'*] -> [t2'*]`
  - note - currently binding from right as discussed in https://github.com/WebAssembly/stack-switching/pull/53

- `resume <typeidx> hdl*`
  - Execute a given continuation.
    - If the executed continuation suspends with a tagged signal `$t`, the corresponding handler `(on $t H)` is executed.
  - `resume $ct hdl* : [t1* (ref null? $ct)] -> [t2*]`
    - iff `C.types[$ct] ~~ cont [t1*] -> [t2*]`
    - and `(hdl : t2*)*`

- `resume_throw <typeidx> <exnidx> hdl*`
  - Execute a given continuation, but force it to immediately throw the annotated exception.
  - Used to abort a continuation.
  - `resume_throw $ct $e hdl* : [te* (ref null? $ct)] -> [t2*]`
    - iff `C.types[$ct] ~~ cont [t1*] -> [t2*]`
    - and `C.tags[$e] : tag $ft`
    - and `C.types[$ft] ~~ func [te*] -> []`
    - and `(hdl : t2*)*`

- `hdl = (on <tagidx> <labelidx>) | (on <tagidx> switch)`
  - Handlers attached to `resume` and `resume_throw`, handling events for `suspend` and `switch`, respectively.
  - `(on $e $l) : t*`
    - iff `C.tags[$e] = tag $ft`
    - and `C.types[$ft] ~~ func [t1*] -> [t2*]`
    - and `C.labels[$l] = [t1'* (ref null? $ct)]`
    - and `t1* <: t1'*`
    - and `C.types[$ct] ~~ cont [t2'*] -> [t'*]`
    - and `[t2*] -> [t*] <: [t2'*] -> [t'*]`
  - `(on $e switch) : t*`
    - iff `C.tags[$e] = tag $ft`
    - and `C.types[$ft] ~~ func [] -> [t*]`

- `suspend <tagidx>`
  - Send a tagged signal to suspend the current computation.
  - `suspend $t : [t1*] -> [t2*]`
    - iff `C.tags[$t] = tag $ft`
    - and `C.types[$ft] ~~ func [t1*] -> [t2*]`

- `switch <typeidx> <tagidx>`
  - Switch to executing a given continuation directly, suspending the current execution.
  - The suspension and switch are performed from the perspective of a parent `(on $e switch)` handler, determined by the annotated tag.
  - `switch $ct1 $e : [t1* (ref null $ct1)] -> [t2*]`
    - iff `C.tags[$e] = tag $ft`
    - and `C.types[$ft] ~~ func [] -> [t*]`
    - and `C.types[$ct1] ~~ cont [t1* (ref null? $ct2)] -> [te1*]`
    - and `te1* <: t*`
    - and `C.types[$ct2] ~~ cont [t2*] -> [te2*]`
    - and `t* <: te2*`

### Execution

The same tag may be used simultaneously by `throw`, `suspend`, `switch`, and their associated handlers. When searching for a handler for an event, only handlers for the matching kind of event are considered, e.g. only `(on $e $l)` handlers can handle `suspend` events and only `(on $e switch)` handlers can handle `switch` events. The handler search continues past handlers for the wrong kind of event, even if they use the correct tag.

### Binary format

We extend the binary format of composite types, heap types, and instructions.

#### Composite types

| Opcode | Type            | Parameters | Note |
| ------ | --------------- | ---------- |------|
| -0x20  | `func t1* t2*`  | `t1* : vec(valtype)` `t2* : vec(valtype)` | from Wasm 1.0 |
| -0x23  | `cont $ft`      | `$ft : typeidx` | new |

#### Heap Types

The opcode for heap types is encoded as an `s33`.

| Opcode | Type            | Parameters | Note |
| ------ | --------------- | ---------- | ---- |
| i >= 0 | i               |            | from function-references |
| -0x0b  | `nocont`        |            | new  |
| -0x18  | `cont`          |            | new  |

### Instructions

| Opcode | Instruction              | Immediates |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ---------- |
| 0xe0   | `cont.new $ct`           | `$ct : u32` |
| 0xe1   | `cont.bind $ct $ct'`     | `$ct : u32`, `$ct' : u32` |
| 0xe2   | `suspend $t`             | `$t : u32` |
| 0xe3   | `resume $ct (on $t $h)*` | `$ct : u32`, `($t : u32 and $h : u32)*` |
| 0xe4   | `resume_throw $ct $e (on $t $h)` | `$ct : u32`, `$e : u32`, `($t : u32 and $h : u32)*` |
| 0xe5   | `switch $ct $e`          | `$ct : u32`, `$e : u32` |
